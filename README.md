# Rollout Quickstart

Provide a [Rollout JWT](https://docs.rollouthq.com/documentation/authenticating-with-rollout) where indicated in the `rollout-demo.html`, then open that file in a browser to see a local Rollout installation.

Use the provided Postman collection or cURL request (with the same Rollout JWT in the `Authorizaiton` header like `BEARER <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>`) to send trigger events in order to execute any Automations you create.
